# Implementation & Compatibility
The cosine curve effect is achieved by adjusting the [solar_power_multiplier](https://lua-api.factorio.com/stable/classes/LuaSurface.html#solar_power_multiplier) property of each surface on each tick, thereby transforming the trapezoidal function into a cosine curve. The mod should be compatible with any mods that don't touch this value themselves.

Curiously yet fortunately, the game doesn't seem to make use of this property at all to my knowledge: In Space Age, the different planets achieve different levels of solar power by [multiplying the production with the "solar-power" surface property](https://lua-api.factorio.com/stable/prototypes/SolarPanelPrototype.html#solar_coefficient_property) defined in their prototype. Thereby, support for other planets (modded too) comes for free.
